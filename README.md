# InspectionReport
Code written during my first co op. The inspection report that we get from our Truck Tracking provider leaves a lot to be desired, so I created my own as an option.
The user selects a truck and which inspection they want on the index.php page.
the inspections.php page uses that info to pull the inspection from the API using a GET request. It then returns all of the info into another page. I tried to keep the layout similar to the one provided to us, but this one displays all the information we actually want.
